Fuck this place up!
You know you're right, I'm just
tired
Correctando, burn our fire
Esta fuerza es me espada
Trippin' on this, no se nada
Anyway, nothing's clear,
analyze what I fear
Anyway, nothing's clear and you
lie
Nuestra vida, driven by you
Pushing our way, stay away
Ruined my life, that is so true
This is our day, piss away
You know you're right,
You're wrong and you know
everything
Correctando, you feel the sting
Take what you brought, the shit
you bring
Our new feeling
Anyway, nothing's clear,
analyze what I fear
Anyway, nothing's clear and you
lie
Este es el amor el que siento
No lo tengo este momento
Este es el amor ella es mia
No la tengo toda vida
Este es el amor es que siento
No lo tengo este momento
Fuck this place up!
Anyway, nothing's clear,
analyze what I fear
Anyway, nothing's clear and you
lie
